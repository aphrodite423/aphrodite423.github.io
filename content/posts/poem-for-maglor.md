**祝歌**

&nbsp;

歌者未曾說與的是，少時他夢見

一場葬禮。神的兒女面容模糊。黑衣垂首沈默如林，

他們摘下北方風化的冠冕熔作七支斷鏃，以追躡

失途之鹿眼中那則冷冽的預言，在潺潺流銀的山心

取用礦燈盞中沈重如鉛的影。最後一雙垂頸的黑羊羔

蹣跚而來，臥膝如幼子。

他們次第經過那棺槨如夜。他探身下看，叩擊那棺木

如來客叩門，“汝為誰悼？”——眾幽靈岑寂對望，耗盡

一整幅攀滿青苔與珊瑚的紀元；竊語的水波漫過他唇：

高懸頭頂的銀紡錘——遙遠王後的遺物，

是你不渝的星座，你如何不知這樂章

虛位以待，殷然盼望的是誰

生長骨肉，安放魂靈？

他醒來。爐膛的火懷抱一段焦木，久哀的母親

從長子身上收回她頭髮的顏色。諸多情節盡已遺落。

最後留存的是他臥倒在年輕海岸，泡沫將剖開

他的軀殼。眾弔唁者因此道賀：

汝等怎以為，冰河下的活埋足以殺死

一顆巖漿煮熟的種；看那被祝福的生者

在哭泣，吻他新娩的琴&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Ode of Blessing** 

&nbsp;

The singer never spoke of it, in his youth he dreamt 

A funeral, God’s children, faces blurred. 

In black robes, heads bowed silent as the forest, 

They removed crowns, weathered by northern winds, 

Forged into seven broken arrows, to chase 

The cold prophecy in a lost deer’s eyes, 

Using heavy shadows, leaden in the lantern’s glow, 

From babbling silver streams at the mountain’s heart. 

The last pair of drooping black lambs 

Staggered forth, laid at the knees like infants.

Passing the coffin like night, he leaned, knocked on the wood 

As one might at a door, "For whom do you mourn?" 

Silent spirits exchanged glances, consuming 

An era clad in moss and coral; whispering waves 

Washed over his lips: 

The silver spindle overhead, relic of distant royalty, 

Your constant constellation. How could you not know 

This melody awaits, eagerly anticipating who 

Will grow flesh, and house the spirit?

He awoke. The hearth's fire embraced a charred log, 

A mother, long mourning, reclaimed the hair color from her eldest. 

Many scenes had been forgotten.

What remained: him lying on the youthful shore, 

Foam ready to split his shell. Thus, the mourners proclaimed: 

"How could you think a burial beneath glaciers 

Could kill a seed boiled by magma? See the blessed living, 

Weeping, kissing his freshly born lyre."
